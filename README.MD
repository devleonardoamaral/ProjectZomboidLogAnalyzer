# Project Zomboid Log Analyzer

The application is an open-source tool developed to collect and process logs generated by the game **Project Zomboid**, allowing players and administrators to analyze significant events recorded during gaming sessions. Utilizing regular expressions (regex), the application filters log entries to extract relevant information, transforming raw data into useful insights.

### Key Features:

- **Log Reading**: The application accesses log files generated by Project Zomboid, allowing sequential reading and processing of new entries as they are added.

- **Regex Filtering**: It implements a customizable regex system that enables users to define specific patterns to capture desired information, such as death events, player interactions, and game state changes.

- **SQLite Database Storage**: Filtered data is stored in an SQLite database, facilitating subsequent querying and analysis. The use of SQLite ensures that the application is lightweight and easy to set up, without the need for complex servers.

- **Dynamic Updates**: The application keeps track of the log reading position, ensuring that only new entries are processed, improving efficiency and reducing overhead.
